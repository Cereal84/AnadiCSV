# Contributing

Please make sure to to the following guidelines to the best.


## Modify the CLI command

If you're working on some CLI option/argument please be aware that the tool is thinked to be working
via Docker/Podman so you have to work both on python arguments (_argparse_) and _anadi.sh_ script.

In _anadi.sh_ please follow the method already used unless you have better method, in that case I'm 
really happy to learn from you a new thing.


## Code quality

Due I'm a 'dirty' developer in order to force me to have at least some code quality standard I
rely on different tools.

All the following tools are visible in `pyproject.toml` file. 

### Formatting

__Tool:__ black
__Configuration:__ default settings.

```console
$ poetry run black anadi/

All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
XX files left unchanged.
```

### Format import order

We use isort in order to fix import order and its format.

__Tool:__ isort
__Configuration:__ default settings.

```console
$ poetry run isort anadi/
```


### Linting

TODO

__Tool:__ ruff
__Configuration:__ details in `pyproject.toml` file.


### Typechecking

TODO

__Tool:__ mypy
__Configuration:__ default settings.

### Pre-commit

### Tests

Even if there is no test at all I prefer to use `pytest` for testing.
